Change log:

This release introduces a major change in the Nhz server architecture.
Instead of being a servlet run by Jetty, Nhz is now a standalone
application which itself launches Jetty servlets, when needed.
This should make it easier to use as a Java library, as it no longer
needs to be run inside a servlet container.

The Nhz configuration has been made more flexible, both for the end user
and for application developers. Nhz no longer uses web.xml, or any xml
files for that matter. Instead, a user-friendly properties file is used.

The layout of the distribution has been changed and simplified. Unpacking
the zip file will produce the following directory structure:

nhz/conf/
This is where the configuration files are kept. All default properties
are in conf/nhz-default.properties. You should never edit this file,
unless you are a packager or client developer who needs different
defaults for his distribution.
All default values are reasonable, so Nhz can just be started without
any configuration. If however the end user wants to customize some
parameters, the way to do that is to create another properties file,
conf/nhz.properties, containing ONLY the properties that need to be
different from the defaults. Nhz will read both nhz-default.properties
and nhz.properties, and the values in nhz.properties will override those
in nhz-default.properties.

nhz/html/
This contains the html files needed for the NRS javascript based client,
under html/nrs, the html-based tools such as admin.html and update.html
under html/tools, and the javadoc documentation for the Java API under
html/doc.

nhz/lib/
This is where all required Java libraries are kept - Jetty, H2 database,
and the JSON-simple library. All Jetty libraries that are not used by Nhz
are no longer included, which also results in a smaller distribution
package.

nhz/nhz.jar
This jar contains all compiled Nhz classes.

nhz/run.sh
This script is the simplest way to start Nhz, under Linux:
java -Xmx1024M -cp nhz.jar:lib/*:conf nhz.Nhz
As you can see, the classpath needs to include nhz.jar, all the jars under
lib, and the conf directory.

Notably missing are start.jar, webapps, and the Jetty configuration
directories, which are no longer needed.

In addition to the switch to embedded Jetty, significant refactoring of the
code has been done, which may be of interest to users of the Java API. The
changes are too many to describe here, but can be easily seen by comparing
the javadoc of 0.8.0 with that of the 0.7 branch. Most notably, interfaces
have been defined for the Block and Transaction classes, the Blockchain
class has been split into several classes, and the Peer and User classes
have also seen some clean up.

Client developers using the Java API can override any of the default
properties by submitting a custom Properties object to Nhz.init().

The configurable properties in nhz-default.properties are all documented in
the comments in that file. Some additional details about those:

Nhz will start up to three different Jetty servers, if needed.

The peer networking server accepts http requests from peers. It is only
started if nhz.shareMyAddress=true (which is the default). If you are behind
a firewall and don't have an externally visible IP, you can set this to false
to disable it.

The port and host interface of the peer server are configurable. If you set
a non-default port in nhz.peerServerPort, this will be appended to the address
you announce to peers (this address should be set in nhz.myAddress). Using
non-default peer networking port hasn't been tested much though.

For a machine with multiple network interfaces, now you can specify on which
interface to bind each server. By default, nhz.peerServerHost=0.0.0.0 so the
peer networking server listens on all interfaces.

There are no hardcoded nhz.wellKnownPeers in the default properties files.
You are supposed to set those to your own preferred peers in nhz.properties.
However, if none are set, a random selection of nhzcrypto.org and nhzbase.com
public nodes will be used.

The DoS Filter is enabled for the peer server only.

The API server accepts http/json API requests. By default, now it runs on port
7776, and listens on the local 127.0.0.1 interface only. If you run a public
node and want to accept API requests from anyone, set nhz.apiServerHost to
0.0.0.0, and nhz.allowedBotHosts to * (or empty).

The nhz.apiResourceBase points to a directory of static html files that are
also served by the API server. Developers of clients using the http/json API
will want to customize this to point to their client html and javascript files.

The Jetty Cross Origin Filter can be enabled for the API server by setting
nhz.apiServerCORS=true (disabled by default).

The UI server is used for the NRS javascript client UI. By default it runs on
port 7775 and accepts requests from localhost only. Client developers using
the same API calls as the NRS client (not the http/json ones) should customize
nhz.uiResourceBase to point to their client html and javascript files instead.

SSL can be enabled for both the API server and the UI server (default disabled).
If this is done, the corresponding ports will accept https requests only. There
is no way currently to have both http and https supported at the same time, but
this can be added, I just didn't see the need for it.
If you enable SSL, you need to set nhz.keyStorePath and nhz.keyStorePassword,
and obviously you need to have your own SSL certificate (self-signed or signed
by a CA) in a keystore file. I have only tested this with a self-signed
certificate.

Client developers using the Java API will probably want to disable both the
API server and the UI server, and for users without a visible IP address
even the peer server.

Debugging output is now disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting
nhz.debug=true. Exception stack traces will still be logged, as long as
nhz.enableStackTraces=true. I hope there will be none of those.

The connection to the database can be completely customized, as the full
jdbc url used to connect to it is exposed in the properties file and can be
modified. Client developers that insist on being able to access the database
from a separate process, while Nhz is running, can do so by appending
;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE to the jdbc url, which will enable automatic mixed-mode.
This is disabled by default, but if you enable it and write to the database
while Nhz is running, expect things to break.

It is also possible to have the database in a different location, not just
in the current working directory, if you change the jdbc url accordingly.

To change the amount of memory used for the database cache, use the
nhz.dbCacheKB parameter, in kilobytes. If set to 0, by default 50 % of the
memory available to the JVM is used for database cache.

There have been no changes to the database schema, you should use your
existing nhz_db directory with this release too, instead of downloading
the blockchain from scratch.

This release is labeled experimental, but please try it. In particular, the
client developers and packagers should test it well, and if there are no
major issues, expect the 0.7 branch to become obsolete soon.
