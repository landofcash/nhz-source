Change log:

Cleaned up error logging and exception handling. There are now two system
properties that can be set to enable additional debug logging: nhz.debug
and nhz.enableStackTraces. Those are defined in start.d/nhz.ini:

	# Enable debug messages
	#-Dnhz.debug

	# Also enable exception stack traces
	-Dnhz.enableStackTraces

	# Disable all jetty warnings and info
	-Dorg.eclipse.jetty.LEVEL=OFF

By default, nhz.debug is disabled. If you watch your log, please do
enable debug output by uncommenting the -Dnhz.debug line in nhz.ini,
and report any bugs using our JIRA issue tracker at Bitbucket:

https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nhz-public/issues

Please avoid submitting duplicate issues, check if a very similar bug
has already been reported first.

The nhz.enableStackTraces parameter activates printing out exception
stack traces in the log, independently of the nhz.debug setting, you
should leave it turned on.

With nhz.debug commented out, Nhz will still print some messages to
the log, but much fewer. If there is a critical exception, it will
be logged even if nhz.debug is not enabled.

The noisy Jetty logging of warnings is disabled and the log should be
much cleaner now. If you enjoy seeing the Jetty warnings, comment out
the -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.LEVEL=OFF line in start.d/nhz.ini, but don't
report those as bugs.

The reason this release is considered experimental is that I have
upgraded Jetty from 9.1.0 to 9.1.1.v20140108. People are encouraged
to try it to see if there are any incompatibilities with different
systems and Java versions.
